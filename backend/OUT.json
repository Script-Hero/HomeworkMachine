Several large cities have more than one paper, but in some of these cities the same business owns both papers. Newspaper circulation has fallen.\n-More people are attracted by radio and television. Younger generations have turned away from political news.\n-The American press is made up of locally owned and managed enterprises. In other nations the media is owned and operated with a national audience in mind.\n-The American news is primarily marketed to the local market and usually there is more local than national news. \n-Until the 1990s no one could own more than one newspaper, AM radio station, and FM radio station in a given market. This resulted in a heavily decentralized broadcast industry.\n\nTHE NATIONAL MEDIA:\n-The local orientation of much of the American media partially offset by certain publications and broadcast services that constitute a kind of national press.\n-The wire services supply most of the national news that local papers publish.\n-News magazines such as Time and Newsweek have a national readership. \n-The evening news broadcasts produced by ABC, CBS, and NBC are carried by most television stations with a network affiliation.\n-Some newspapers like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have acquired national influence.\n-These newspapers have national standing for several reasons:\n1. They distribute a lot of copies.\n2. These papers are carefully followed by political elites.\n3. Radio and television stations often decide what to broadcast by looking at the front pages of these prominent national newspapers.\n4.

Every day he did something newsworthy. He created a special room for reporters in the White House.\n-Franklin Roosevelt institutionalized this system and made his press secretary a major instrument for cultivating and managing as well as informing the press.\n-Today the press secretary heads a large staff that meets with reporters, briefs the president on questions he will be asked, and attempts to control the flow of news from cabinet departments to the press.\n-No other nation in the world has brought the press so close to the head of its government.\n\nCOVERAGE OF CONGRESS:\n-Congress has watched all this with irritation and envy. They want press attention but it is not certain how it can compete.\n-There are so many members of Congress which play numerous specialized rules that they do not get much individualized press attention.\n-The House was quite restrictive about television until 1978 when it allowed television cameras on the floor.\n-Significant live coverage of committee hearings began in 1974 when the House was discussing the impeachment of President Nixon.\n-Since 1979, cable TV has provided gavel-to-gavel coverage of speeches on the House floor.\n-The Senate has used television much more fully.

There were few large advertisers to pay the bills so the newspapers required subsidies that frequently came from the government or a political party.\n-The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, created the Gazzette of the United States. The Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, retaliated by creating the National Gazette. Ever since, presidents have started and subsidized newspapers. \n-Due to this party control, newspapers were relentlessly partisan in their views.\n-Only a few people read newspapers.\n\nTHE POPULAR PRESS:\n-Changes in society and technology made possible the rise of a self-supporting, mass-readership daily newspaper.\n-High-speed rotary press enabled publishers to print thousands of copies of a newspaper cheaply and quickly. The invention of the telegraph and the creation of the Associated Press in 1848 allowed the telegraphic dissemination of information to newspaper editors on a systematic basis. AP provided stories that had to be brief and that went to newspapers of every political hue. Because of this, they could not afford to be partisan or biased.\n-Newspapers soon didn't need government subsidies and all printing contracts that Washington newspapers once enjoyed were put to an end.\n-The mass-readership newspaper was scarcely nonpartisan, but he partisanship it displayed arose from the convictions of its publishers and editors rather than the influence of its party sponsors.\n-Sensationalism seeped into newspapers so as to provide great appeal for the average citizen.\n-Strong-willed publishers could often become powerful political forces. William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer.\n-Mass-readership newspapers began to create a common national culture, to establish feasibility of a press free of government and to demonstrate how exciting and profitable the criticism of public policy and the revelation of public scandal could be.\n-Mass politics arose and every had access to newspapers\n\nMAGAZINES OF OPINION:\n-These magazines grew out of a desire of the middle class for political reform and a belief in the progressive movement.\n-National magazines devoted to issues of public policy sprouted.\n-These magazines provided the means for developing a national constituency for certain issues.\n-In time, the great circulation wars between big-city daily newspapers started to wane, as the mores successful papers bought up or otherwise eliminated their competition.\n-This reduced the need for sensationalism.\n-In the late 19th century, politics dominated the pages of most national magazine. \n-Interest groups formed\n\nELECTRONIC JOURNALISM:\n-Radio came on the national scene in the 1920s. Television came in the 1940s.\n-This represented a major change in the way news was gathered and disseminated.\n-A broadcast allows public officials to speak directly to audiences without their remarks being filtered through editors and reporters. They could reach the nation without reliance on the services of parties, interest groups, or friendly editors .\n-Regardless, there was an offsetting disadvantage: people could easily ignore a speech broadcast on a radio or television station, either by not listening at all or by tuning to a different station. By contrast, the views of politicians and public figures would receive prominent and often unavoidable display in newspapers.\n-On top of this, newspapers were cheaper and could carry more information than a broadcast on radio or television.\n-To gain electronic media coverage, then, public officials had to do something noticeable and sensational to gain free access to radio and television news.\n-As television became more popular, public officials had to do something more exciting to receive access to television or radio. Once they received attention, they received very little time and had to do something that kept the audience awake instead of having some traditional \"talking-heads\" news shows.\n-Politicians are able to build bridges to voters \n\nTHE INTERNET:\n-The internet has been widely used by a majority of all Americans to get political news about elections.\n-The internet is the ultimate free market in political news: no one can ban, control, or regulate it, and no one can keep facts, opinions, or nonsense off of it.\n-The internet allowed for:\n1. Scanning political ideas posted on blogs. \n2. It played a huge rule in politics and elections\n3. Voters and political activists can talk to each other.\n-The internet has profoundly affected politics by making it easier to:\n1. Raise money in donations\n2. Organize people to attend meetings\n3.

Why are conservative talk shows so common?:\n1. There are more self-described conservatives than liberals in this country.\n2. Conservative listeners do not think their views are reflected in what big-city newspapers, the major television networks, and leading news magazines display.\n3. Much of the liberal audience is broken up into distinctive racial and ethnic groups that have their own radio outlets.\n\nNEUTRAL AND OBJECTIVE?:\n-In the US, the journalistic philosophy in many media documents is that the press, when it reports news should be neutral and objective. This rule does not cover radio talk shows, but it does cover newspapers. In other nations, newspapers are owned by one party or the other, and therefore the rule of neutral and objective does not work.\n-It is hard to measure if news stories are really objective because one would have to take into account many details, including the tone and adjectives used to describe people and policies.\n-News stories often significantly differ in the opportunity for bias:\n1. Routine stories cover major political events that will be covered by many reporters and that involve relatively simple matters. Routine stories are covered in the same way by reporters. \n2. Feature stories cover events that, though public, a reporter has to seek out because they are not routinely covered. \n3. Insider stories cover things that are often secret. \n-Feature and insider stores may more easily reflect the views of reporters and editors.\n-Early in the history, newspapers had virtually no routine stories. Everything was an expression of opinion.\n-By the 20th century, the advent of the telephone and telegraph lines made it easy for news organizations to send the same story to almost every newspaper resulting in commonplace routine stories.\n-With the advent of radio and television, feature and insider stores became much more important for newspapers to compete with the routine stores of television and radio.\n-The way certain newspapers and magazines describe and cover certain politicians and issues find that the editors and journalists are sometimes biased in the way they describe.\n-A newspaper's bias tends to reflect the political views of its readers rather than the views of the publishers.\n-Public distrust of the media has grown and so the number of people who believe news organizations has declined.\n\nMEDIA'S INFLUENCE:\n-Some people will be influenced by what they read or hear but others will not be.\n-There is a well-known psychological process called selective attention. It means that people remember and believe only what they want to. If they see things inconsistent with their beliefs, they will tune out these messages.\n-A study found two things:\n1. Newspapers that endorsed incumbents on their editorial pages gave more positive news coverage to them than newspapers that did not endorse them\n2.
